\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we extend an emperical root density distribution based
  on densely populated homogenious fields to row crops.  The row crops
  are modeled as having a uniform density in the direction parallel to
  the rows, but variable in the direction perpindicular to the row.
  In each case how to find the distribution parameters from the root
  dry matter and the size of the root zone.
\end{abstract}

\section{Densily populated fields}

In accordance with \cite{gp74}, the root density distribution $L_z$
for a crop can be described by
\begin{equation}
  L_z = L_0\, e^{-a z}
  \label{eq:g+p}
\end{equation}
where $L_0$ is the root density at the soil surface, $a$ is a
distribution parameter, and $z$ is the depth below soil surface.

We here assume that the density is uniformly distributed on the
horizontal plane, an assumption that fails with e.g.\ row crops.

The parameters $a$ and $L_0$ will both vary with time.  For a
production oriented simulation model like
Daisy~\citep{daisy-fertilizer,daisy-ems}, it can be more convenient to
specify the density in terms of accumulated root dry matter $M_r$ and
total root depth $d_c$, as described in \cite{daisy-def} or the
following.

We define the root depth at the lowest depth where the root density is
at above specified threshold $L_m$.  By inserting this in
\eqref{eq:g+p}, we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L_{d_c} = L_0\, e^{-a d_c}
  \label{eq:root-depth}
\end{equation}

We convert the root mass to root length $l_r$ by assuming the specific
root length $S_r$ is a known constant (rather than varying with depth)
\begin{equation}
  l_r = S_r \, M_r
  \label{eq:root-length}
\end{equation}

The total root length is also the integral of the root density over
the profile
\begin{equation}
  l_r = \int_0^{\infty} L_z \: dz 
      = \int_0^{\infty} L_0\, e^{-a z} \, dz 
      = \frac{L_0}{a}
  \label{eq:root-integral}
\end{equation}

By inserting the expression we get for $L_0$ from
\eqref{eq:root-integral} in \eqref{eq:root-depth} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_r \, a \, e^{-a d_c}
  \label{eq:a-only}
\end{equation}

If we substitute $W = -a d_c$ and isolate the known values on the right
side this gives us
\begin{equation}
   W e^W = - L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}
  \label{eq:Lambert}
\end{equation}
The solution to this equation with regard to $W$ happens to be the
definition of the Lambert-W function \citep{euler83,lambert58}.  The
function on the left hand side of the equation is depicted on
figure~\ref{fig:W}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_W}
  \caption{$W e^W$}
  \label{fig:W}
\end{figure}

Since we now know the value for $W$m we can find the desired density
parameters $L_0$ and $a$ by substituting back
\begin{eqnarray}
   a   &=& -W / d_c\\\label{eq:a-solved}
   L_0 &=& \frac{L_m}{e^{-a d_c}} = L_m e^{a d_c}\label{eq:L0-found}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Numeric solution to $W$}

We start by dividing the funtions into monotonic intervals by finding
the derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d W\, e^W}{dW} = e^W + W e^W
  \label{eq:derived-W}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  e^W + W e^W = 0
  \label{eq:derived-W-solutions}
\end{equation}
has one solution, $W=-1$. The expression $W\, e^W$ is decreasing below
$-1$ and increasing above $-1$.  Thus, $W=0$ is a global minimum.

Since $\lim_{Q\to-\infty} W\,e^W=0$ we get a single solution when
$-L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}$ is exactly at the bottom point ($-1 e^{-1}$), two
when it is above (it is never positive), and none when it is below.
The later situation corresponds to the case where there are
insufficent root $l_r$ to satisfy the minimal root density $L_m$
within the given root zone $d_c$.

Both solutions are valid, but represent different distributions.
\begin{itemize} 
\item The solution for $W < -1$ represents a large $a$ parameter. From
  \eqref{eq:L0-found} we see this also means $L_0$ is large.  Thus,
  the solution corresponds to a root zone with a high density near the
  top that decreases rapidly to $L_m$ at the bottom of the root zone,
  and continues to decrease so only a small contribution to the total
  root length from below he root zone.
\item The solution for $W > -1$ (and thus small values of $a$ and
  $L_0$) corresponds to a low root density near the top that
  decreases slowly, and thus gives a larger contribution to the total
  root length from below the root zone.
\end{itemize}
As the total root length increases, pressing $W$ towards $0$ or
$-\infty$, the difference between the solutions grow.  When there is
just enough roots to satisfy the contraints at $W = -1$, the two
solutions converges to one.  As we like our roots to stay mostly
within the root zone, we choose the solution for $W < -1$.  We can
thus find $W$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-2$.

\subsection{Limited growth}

The distribution in \eqref{eq:g+p} implies a gradual decrease of roots
going towards, but never reaching zero.  There are two problems with
this.  The first one is emprical, for some soils it doesn't match what
we observe, rather than a gradual decrease, there is sharp decrease at
a specific depth, as the roots are unable to penetrate further
down~\cite{limroot}. The other one is practical, too large a root zone
makes computation impractical.

The way we model the first issue is to divide the root depth into a
crop specific and soil independent potential root depth $d_c$, and soil
specific and crop independent maximum root depth $d_s$.  The actual
root depth $d_a$ is then the shallowest of these two.
\begin{equation}
  d_a = \min (d_c, d_s)
  \label{eq:actual-depth}
\end{equation}

We now create a modified root density function $L_z^*$ by defining it to
zero below $d_a$, and a $L_z$ scaled to preserve mass balance above.
\begin{equation}
  L_z^* =
  \begin{cases}
    k^* L_z & \text{if $z \leq d_a$}\\
    0 & \text{if $z > d_a$}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:limited-depth}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  k^* = \frac{l_r}{\int_0^{d_a} L_z \, dz}
  \label{eq:scale-factor}
\end{equation}
thus solving both problems.

\section{Row crops}

We can describe a row crop with a two dimensional model by assuming
that the plants are densily packed in the row.  Our second dimension
$x$ is horizontal, ortogonal to the row.  The root density at a
specific point can be denoted $L_{z,x}$, and we chooce origo so
$L_{0,0}$ is the the root density in the top of the row.  See
figure~\ref{fig:row-crop}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  TODO: Insert figure here.
  \caption{Crop row.}
  \label{fig:row-crop}
\end{figure}

We then define the following root dstribution
\begin{equation}
  L_{z,x} = L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x}
  \label{eq:Lzx}
\end{equation}
where $a_z$ and $a_z$ control the density decrease in the two
dimensions.

\subsection{Finding the parameters}

To find the parameters $a_z$, $a_x$ and $L_{0,0}$, we assume as before
that the root depth and root mass is known, and now additionally that
the root radius $w_c$ is known.  We define the root zone depth $d_c$
to be the depth right below the row ($x = 0$) where the root density
is $L_m$.  As $x=0$ is the place where \eqref{eq:Lzx} predicts the
highest density, the average root density at that depth will be well
below $L_m$.  Similarily, we define the radius $w_c$ as the horizontal
distance from the row where the root density at the surface ($z = 0$)
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L_{d,0} = L_{0,r}
  \label{eq:minroot}
\end{equation}

The total root length on one side of the row ($l_R$), which we assume
is known from our crop model, is the integral of the root density over
the half plane
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    l_R &=& \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L_{z,x} \: dz \, dx \\
        &=& \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x} \: dz \, dx\\
        &=& \frac{L_{0,0}}{a_z a_x}\\ 
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:root-integral2}
\end{equation}
Thus \eqref{eq:Lzx} can be rewritten 
\begin{equation}
  L_{z,x} = l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x}  
  \label{eq:azx}
\end{equation}

By using \eqref{eq:azx} in \eqref{eq:minroot} we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z d} \\\label{eq:Ld0}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_x r}\label{eq:L0r}
\end{eqnarray}
Thus $e^{-a_z d} = e^{-a_x r}$ or
\begin{equation}
  a_x = \frac{d_c}{w_c} a_z
  \label{eq:aztoax}
\end{equation}

By inserting \eqref{eq:aztoax} in \eqref{eq:Ld0} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_R\, a_z\, \frac{d}{r} a_z \, e^{-a_z d}
  \label{eq:azeq1}
\end{equation}

If we substitute 
\begin{equation}
  Q = -a_z d
  \label{eq:Qaz}
\end{equation}
and isolate the known values on the right side, this gives us:
\begin{equation}
  Q^2\, e^Q = L_m \frac{d \, r}{l_R}
  \label{eq:logsquare}
\end{equation}
The left hand side expression is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:Q}.
Unlike \eqref{eq:Lambert}, nobody bothered to give the solution to
\eqref{eq:logsquare} a name.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_Q}
  \caption{$Q^2 e^Q$}
  \label{fig:Q}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Numeric solution to $Q$}

We start by dividing the funtions into monotonic intervals by finding
the derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d (Q^2\, e^Q)}{dQ} = 2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q
  \label{eq:derived}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q = 0
  \label{eq:derived-solutions}
\end{equation}
has two solutions, $Q=0$ and $Q=-2$, and the expression $Q^2\, e^Q$ is
increasing below $-2$, decreasing between $-2$ and $0$, and increasing
above $0$. Thus, $Q=0$ is a local (and in this case also global)
minimum, and $Q=-2$ is a local maximum.

We are not interested in positive values for $Q$, they correspond to
negative values for $a_z$, and the simplification in
\eqref{eq:root-integral2} are only valid if $a_z > 0$.  

Since $\lim_{Q\to-\infty} Q^2\,e^Q=0$ we get a single negative
solution when $L_m \frac{d \, r}{l_R}$ is exactly at the top point
($2^2 e^{-2}$), two when it is smaller (it is never negative), and
none when it is larger.  The later situation corresponds to the case
where there are insufficent root $l_R$ to satisfy the minimal root
density $L_m$ within the given root zone $d\, r$. 

Both negative solutions are valid, but represent different
distributions.
\begin{itemize} 
\item The solution for $Q < -2$ represents a large $a_z$ (and thus
  also $a_x$) parameter. From \eqref{eq:root-integral2} we see this
  also means $L_{0,0}$ is large.  Thus, the solution corresponds to a
  root zone with a high density near the center that decreases rapidly
  to $L_m$ near the edge of the root zone, and continues to decrease
  so only a small contribution to the total root length fro outside
  the root zone.
\item The solution for $Q > -2$ (and thus small values of $a_x$, $a_x$
  and $L_{0,0}$) corresponds to a low root density near the center
  that decreases slowly, and thus gives a larger contribution to the
  total root length from outside the root zone.  
\end{itemize}
As the total root length increases, pressing $Q$ towards $0$ or
$-\infty$, the difference between the solutions grow.  When there is just
enough roots to satisfy the contraints at $Q = -2$, the two solutions
converges to one.  As we like our roots to stay mostly within the root
zone, we choose the solution for $Q < -2$.

We can find $Q$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-3$.  From that we can find $a_z$ from \eqref{eq:Qaz}, $a_x$ from
\eqref{eq:aztoax}, and $L_{0,0}$ from \eqref{eq:root-integral2}.

\subsection{Multiple rows}

If the rows are close enough, the root systems will overlap as shown
on figure~\ref{fig:zigzag}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_L}
  \caption{The x-axis represents the distance from a row to the
    midpoint between it and the row to its right.  The y-axis is the
    root density for roots originating in a specific row.  The top
    line represents the roots from the row itself.  The next line the
    roots from the row to the right.  And the last line the roots from
    the row to the left.  In theory, all the rows on the field will
    contibute some roots to the interval.  The root density in the
    interval will be the sum of all the individual contributions.}
  \label{fig:zigzag}
\end{figure}

If $R$ is the distance between rows, and we assume an infinite number
of identical rows, this can be expressed by the equation
\begin{equation}
  L^*_{z,x} =
    \begin{cases}
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L_{z,x + i R} + L_{z,R + i R - x}) & \text{if $x < R/2$}\\
                                                    0  & \text{if $x \geq R/2$}
    \end{cases}
  \label{eq:Lzxstar}
\end{equation}

Using \eqref{eq:Lzx} and the rules for geometric serieses we can rewrite
the first case to get rid of the sum
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rl}
     & \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L_{z,x + i R} + L_{z,R + i R - x})\\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} 
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (e^{-a_x (x + i R)} + e^{-a_x (R + i R - x)})\\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (       e^{-a_x x} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R} 
                          + e^{-a_x (R - x)} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R})\\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R}) \\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ((\frac{1}{e})^{a_x R})^i\\
    =& \frac{L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})}
            {1 - \frac{1}{e}^{a_x R}}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:Lzxstar-solved}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mapping between the models}

We would like to retain our original distribution when ignoring the x
dimension.  We coudn't do that when looking only at the root system
for a single row, as it is infinitely wide and thus has an average
density of zero.  However, if we look at the roots of single row, we
get
\begin{equation}
  L_z = \frac{2 \int_0^{\infty} L_{z,x}\, dx}{R}
  \label{eq:x-integrated}
\end{equation}
We multiply by two as we assume the two sides of the rows are
identical.  By integrating to $\infty$ rather than just $R/2$ we do
include roots from outside the row.  However, because the system has
an infinite number of identical rows, the amount of roots from the
crop outside its own row is exactly the same as the amount of roots
from other rows inside the row we are examining.

Inserting \eqref{eq:Lzx} and \eqref{eq:g+p} in \eqref{eq:x-integrated} we get
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    L_0\, e^{-a z} &=& \frac{2}{R} \int_{0}^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x} dx\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z}}{R} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x x} dx\\
                 &=& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} \frac{0 - 1}{-a_x}\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{R a_x} e^{-a_z z}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:1d2d}
\end{equation}
So we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  a_z &=& a\\\label{eq:azisa}
  L_{0,0} &=& ½ a_x R L_0\\\label{eq:L00L0}
  L_0 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{a_x R}\label{eq:L0L00}
\end{eqnarray}
as the equation to use when switching between the one and two
dimensional descriptions.
